## Running the Server

You need to have nodejs installed if you do not. It can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once it is installed, go to the directory where you have cloned this repo in your command line. Then do the command:

`node app.js`

The server should start and display the port on which it is running. It can then be accessed at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081), assuming you did not change the port.
